-- ELEC241 Practice Referral --

Here are the tasks I have managed for this referral: 

 - Presentation

	- I am happy with this presentation, and believe it is adequate for the marking scheme. 
		- My notes for it are included (not sure it is needed). 
		- Relevant links are within the PowerPoint.

 - Management

	- I have kept track of myself throughout this presentation.
		- Kanban Board, with short updates.
			- Kanban changes are screenshotted in the OneNote file.
		- OneNote updates regularly, showing an in-depth look at what I am doing/have done.

	- GitHub shows the version control well.
		- There are suitable comments, and brief descriptions of all changes I made.
		- Occasional update within my OneNote document; for more detail, the marker should have access to the GitHub repository.

 - SPI Master

	- Followed the inputs and outputs that were supplied.
	- Testbench started, not completed.


 - Buffer

	- Quite simple (if I am correct)
	- Testbench not started but a component plan is in place. I hope this can show my understanding. Not completed due to timing.
